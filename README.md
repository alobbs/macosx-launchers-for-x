MacOS X-like launchers for lightweight X-Window desktops
========================================================

This is a workaround to implement the single application instance
approach that MacOS X implements.

Some rather heavy desktops implements this feature already, GNOME3 and
Unity for instance. However, this functionality is missing in most of
the other -usually lighter- desktop environments.

This code is just me scratching my own itch. My personal preferences
are actually hardcoded into the code, so odds are this repo is not the
one you were looking for ;)
